# MackenzieLukic-ProfessionalPortfolio

My professional portfolio for Challenge 2. As as graphic designer and budding developer, I wanted to display a sleek, modern and portfolio design while expressing some unique developement flavour. 

I have utlised some light animation and transistion effects to create a more interactive feel, while also using a z-index and positioning technique to the footer for a modern web look. 


Note:

I experienced an issue wehere the hero image (using background:url();) does not display when the site is deployed to github pages. Below I have included of what the site should look like when viewed locally.

I have opted for a plain black background as a fallback to this issue.
